		<h1>The Cat Who Lived a Million Times</h1><br>
		<h2>Japanese Poem</h2>
		<p>There was a cat who could live for a million years.<br>
He died a million times, and lived a million times.<br>
He was a great tiger-striped cat.<br>
A million people adored the cat,<br>
And a million people cried when that cat died.<br>
The cat never cried, not even once.<br><br>

Once, the cat was a king's cat.<br>
The cat hated the king.<br>
The king was great at war, and was always at war.<br>
And, he put the cat in a magnificent cage,<br>
And took him out to war.<br>
One day, the cat was hit by a flying arrow, and died.<br>
The king embraced the cat and wailed during the battle.<br>
The king stopped the war and returned to his castle.<br>
And, he buried the cat in the castle's garden.<br><br>

Once, the cat was a sailor's cat.<br>
The cat hated the seas.<br>
The sailor took the cat to all the seas of the world,<br>
And all the ports of the world.<br>
One day, the cat fell off the boat.<br>
The cat could not swim.<br>
The sailor hurriedly scooped up the cat with his net,<br>
But the cat was soaked and dead.<br>
The sailor embraced the cat which was now like a wet rag,<br>
And wailed in a loud voice.<br>
And, he buried the cat under the tree<br>
In a park in a far-away port.<br><br>

Once, the cat was the cat of a magician in a circus.<br>
The cat hated the circus.<br>
The magician put the cat inside a box every day,<br>
And cut him in half with a saw.<br>
Then, he removed the cat, still in one piece,<br>
Out of the box to receive his applause.<br>
One day, the magician made a mistake,<br>
And really cut the cat in half.<br>
The magician wailed in a loud voice,<br>
Holding the two parts of the cat in each hand.<br>
Nobody applauded him.<br>
The magician then buried the cat behind the circus tent.<br><br>

Once, the cat was a burglar's cat.<br>
The cat hated burglars.<br>
The burglar walked quietly through the dark town with the cat,<br>
Just like a cat.<br>
The burglar robbed only houses with dogs.<br>
While the dog was barking at the cat,<br>
The burglar opened the safes.<br>
One day, the cat was bitten to death by the dog.<br>
The burglar embraced the cat with the diamonds he stole,<br>
And walked through the night town wailing in a loud voice.<br>
Then, he went home and buried the cat in a small yard.<br><br>

Once, the cat was the cat of a lonely grandmother.<br>
The cat hated grandmothers.<br>
The grandmother looked outside every day from a small window,<br>
Holding the cat in her arms.<br>
The cat was asleep all day on top of the grandmother's lap.<br>
Time passed, and the cat died of old age.<br>
The frail grandmother embraced the frail dead cat,<br>
And cried all day.<br>
The grandmother buried the cat under a tree in the yard.<br><br>

Once, the cat was a little girl's cat.<br>
The cat hated children.<br>
The girl piggy-backed the cat, and slept clutching the cat.<br>
When she cried, she wiped her tears on the cat's back.<br>
One day atop the girl's back,<br>
The holster to keep the cat secure wound around his neck,<br>
And the cat died.<br>
Holding the cat with the dangly neck, the girl cried all day.<br>
And, she buried the cat under a tree in the yard.<br><br>

The cat had no fear of dying.<br>
Once, the cat wasn't anyone's cat.<br>
He was a stray cat.<br>
The cat was able to be his own cat for the first time.<br>
The cat loved himself.<br>
Since he was a great tiger-striped cat,<br>
He became a great stray cat.<br>
All the female cats wanted to be the cat's wife.<br>
There were cats that gave him huge fish.<br>
Others gave him premium mice.<br>
Some cats brought rare catnip as a gift.<br>
Other cats licked his tiger fur for him.<br>
The cat said to all of them—<br>
"I've died a million times! This is so ridiculous now!"<br>
The cat loved himself more than anyone else.<br><br>

But there was just one beautiful white cat <br>
That didn't even look at the cat.<br>
The cat went over next to the white cat, and told her,<br>
"I died a million times!"<br>
The white cat just said, "Oh."<br>
The cat became slightly upset, since he loved himself.<br>
The next day, and the day after that, <br>
The cat went over to the white cat and told her,<br>
"You haven't even finished one life."<br>
The white cat just said, "Oh."<br>
One day, the cat did three somersaults in front of the white cat,<br>
and said, "I once was a cat for a circus."<br>
The white cat just said, "Oh."<br>
The cat started to say, "I have had a million—"<br>
Then asked the white cat, "Can I be at your side?"<br>
The white cat said, "Yes."<br><br>

The cat stayed by the white cat for a long time.<br>
The white cat had many cute kittens.<br>
The cat no longer dared to say "I have had a million—"<br>
The cat loved the white cat and all the many kittens<br>
Even more than himself.<br>
As time passed, the kittens grew up and all went away.<br>
The cat, satisfied, said, "They became great stray cats now."<br>
The white cat said, "Yes," and softly purred her throat.<br>
The white cat had become a grandmother cat.<br>
The cat purred his throat even more softly.<br>
The cat thought that he wanted to live forever with the white cat.<br><br>

One day, the white cat quietly stopped moving next to the cat.<br>
The cat cried for the first time in his life.<br><br>
Night came, morning came,<br>
Night came again, and morning came again.<br>
The cat cried a million times.<br><br>
Morning came, night came—<br>
and one afternoon, the cat stopped crying.<br>
The cat, next to the white cat, quietly stopped moving.<br>
The cat never came back to life again. </p>
